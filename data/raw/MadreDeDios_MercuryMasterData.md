# MadreDeDios_MercuryMasterData.xlsx

Email from Ben on 11 June 2021

> Hi everyone, 
>
>  
>
> Just wanted to send out an email to inform everyone that I updated the Madre de Dios data. 
>
>  
>
> The master data sheet for Madre de Dios is in Box and is called [MadreDeDios_MercuryMasterData](https://duke.app.box.com/file/819950287235).
>
> The main updates were that I added the specific spatial coordinates to the [Martinez_2018](https://duke.app.box.com/file/786163950722) data, which has a ton of good data about fish. 
>
>  
>
> I also went ahead and separated out the data so that every point has a sample size of 1 (as opposed to having a sample size of more than 1, which, as Shannon pointed out, was the case before for quite a few of the data points). Because of these changes, I would suggest re-mapping the points.

> Thank you for including me on the project and again, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions.
