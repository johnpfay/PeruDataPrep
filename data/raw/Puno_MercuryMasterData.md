Hi team,

 

I've attached the data set that has all of the data Jackie and I have been able to extract for Puno so far. I have also attached the data references list for all the Puno data. All of the data we have extracted for Puno is in Box under this folder:

[Mercury Puno files](https://duke.box.com/s/4fdpfl7527wk9ewvm8cjxntdmovvkgtx)

 

Additionally, here is a link to the google sheets for the Puno data extraction that can be used as a backup if need be:

At the moment, there are two papers that have mercury concentration and spatial data that I have not been able to interpret (See attached "Supplementary information Guédron 2017" and "Supplementary information Guedron 2020"). If anyone can interpret the mercury concentration values in those (properly convert them to ppm), I can add them into the master data set before the end of the week.

 

I really need to start committing to my job search full-time, so after this week, I'm not going to be able to work on this project. 

 

I am free to meet one more time before the end of the week to go over the data extraction process, answer questions about the Puno data set, and anything else that is needed before the end of the week. 

 

Here is a when2meet for Friday-Sunday to figure out when people are available for a final meeting:

I can field questions after this week, I just won't be able to commit large amounts of time to the project after Sunday.

 

Thank you all, it's been a pleasure to work with everyone. 

 

All the best,

Ben
