Hi John,

Perfect, thanks for the clarification. Here is the dataset with a column that gives the "Year(s) data was collected." 

 

Also, here is the link to the google sheets: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_INaG5okA4mQ44GeDOL2JdC0bT5BZIVtPxWQbinmZaA/edit?usp=sharing

Get stuff done with or without an internet connection. Use  Sheets to edit Excel files. Free from Google.  docs.google.com

The sheets aren't very well organized, but at least it's some sort of backup. There are better backups in Box under this folder: https://duke.box.com/s/enns9vud0akageo5vl70kfkgv5ybc1z1

 

I haven't had much time to look at the GIS demo yet, but I plan on looking at it tomorrow.

 

Thanks for all the help and let me know if you have any other questions.

 

All the best,

Ben

Good question. For simplicity sake (on your part), you can just enter it as the start and end year separated by a dash. If you keep it consistent, it wouldn’t be too hard to deal with a different format with some code.

Hi John, 

Quick question: How should I organize the excel file for data that was taken across a range of years (Ex. 1990-1993)? Some papers don't say the exact year data was taken and just gives a range of years in a couple of cases.

 

Thank you,

Ben

Hey Ben et al,

 

That is a nice tidy dataset for the most part. A few questions though:

·     In the Margin of Error field, some values have a +/- and some don’t. Can I assume all values represent a +/- around the provided ppm value? 

·     The only dates given are in the Author field and some don’t have dates (e.g. HUNT and IOH). Is there any way to discern which are publication dates and which are dates the data were collected? And do the ones with no dates simply have no record of when they were collected/published?

 

And a quick preview of a dashboard I’m assembling: 

https://dukeuniv.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/662abfa3f0d04f70a7c9437a1af485db

Note that you can click on a checkbox or bar and it will subset the data. You can also zoom in on the map and the bar plot will reflect just the sample points shown on the map. Should get more interesting as I’m able to wrangle more data into the dashboard (e.g. year)…

Hi John,

Here is the master data sheet for all of the mercury data we have in Madre de Dios. 

 

The file is also in Box under:

Mercury Risk-Map Project -----> Data Files -----> Mercury Madre de Dios files

 

Let me know if you have any questions.

 

All the best,

Ben
