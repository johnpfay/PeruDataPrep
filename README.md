# Peru Data Prep



### PROJECT MOTIVATION 

Mercury cycles through the environment, but the movement through different biota and the resulting  risk of human exposure is poorly defined. 



### PROJECT OBJECTIVES

1. Create a searchable, online GIS database of existing mercury measurement data for Madre de Dios and Puno;
2. Develop tools for exploring spatial distributions of mercury levels across different biota (marine and terrestrial animals and plants), water, air, and human samples;
3. Develop spatial & statistical models for evaluating mercury levels among different biota



### WORKSPACE OBJECTIVES

Here we take data extracted from peer reviewed literature and compile a central data repository using **ESRI's ArcGIS Online**. This platform offers the following advantages:

* Centralized data management.
* Data access controlled at the user, group, and organizational level for every file.
* Access to the data via web browser, application (ArcGIS Desktop/Pro), or via scripting API.
* Online visualization of data in map and chart based formats, including comparison to other datasets.
* Development of interactive applications including story maps and dashboards. 

This workspace includes proof-of-concept scripts used to migrate raw CSV files to the AGOL environment, exploration of data.
